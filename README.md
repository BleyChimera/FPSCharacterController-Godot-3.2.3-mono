# FPS Character Controller  for Godot 3.2.3 mono
This project was created with the only intention of making a character controller that doesn't slide on slopes but struggles to go up steep slopes AND is easier to go downhill.

This project requires a mono version of godot (3.2.3 is the one I recomend).

You have my permission to use this code and modify it without any limitation.

## Features:

    -WASD/Space + Mouse support
    -You won't slide on slopes
    -Jumping
    -Bonking your head on celings
    -Ceiling climb (early)

## Features planned for the future:

    -Full controller support
    -A way to disable struggling to go up
    -Full ceiling cling mechanic
    -Yote timer for jumps
